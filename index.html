                  <p>I was born on the third day of the Chinese New Year in 1994, in Kaohsiung, south of Taiwan. I have a one-year younger sister who is also an Aquarius, but our personalities are far different. Like the sun in the south, my personality is always optimistic, warm, and intelligent. Since seeking better academic development, I left home after elementary school to go to a boarding school and stayed abroad for more than a decade, which cultivated my independent side. </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                  <p>If you have studied the horoscope, you will know that as an Aquarius, I am a curious baby. My interests have been growing since I was a kid, from science fiction space and Greek mythology to horseback riding and wine tasting as I grew up, and in the last few years, I started to be interested in IT and business. As age grows, the things that I like become more and more realistic.</p>

                <h2>Experiences</h2>
                  <p>As the millennial generation, we have abundant resources. While in university, I not only completed a bachelor's degree in biotechnology but also learned a lot of additional knowledge, such as beauty certification and financial insurance license. After graduation, I served in the hospital for three years and devoted myself to medicine in my motherland until I decided to stay here and study in a different field when I came to Canada at the age of 25. Now, I am a student at <abbr title="Southern Alberta 
                    Institute of Technology">SAIT</abbr>.</p>
